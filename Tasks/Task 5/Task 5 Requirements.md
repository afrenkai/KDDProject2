Task 5: Model Selection, Training, and Optimization

In this task, youâ€™ll identify and train at least five distinct machine learning
models apt for your classification task. Following that, try to boost the perfor-
mance of the models using suitable techniques. For example, feature engineering,
cross-validation, grid search, tuning model hyperparameters, etc. Try at least
three techniques and compare the performance with the vanilla ones.
