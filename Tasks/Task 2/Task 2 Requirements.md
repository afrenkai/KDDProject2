Task 2: EDA

Perform exploratory analysis on the data. Research online for ideas, and then
show analysis on at least five different aspects of the dataset. Analyze your
findings.
Note 1: This part is open-ended, any valid analysis is fine as long as it useful
for you to understand the data better! Use visualizations when necessary.
Note 2: If you choose to combine your Project 1 datasets, make sure the
EDA highlights the integrated nature of the dataset (do not reuse the two
independent EDAs from Project 1)

Current Ideas:
1. Image Size
2. Class Imbalance
3. Hierarchical Clustering
4. Color Distribution (RGB Distribution)
5. Gabor Filters
