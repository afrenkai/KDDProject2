Task 6: Model Evaluation
1. Use at least four metrics to evaluate the performance of your selected
models.
2. Analyze the experimental results and report your conclusion. The analysis
should compare results (using the metrics you chose above) the different pre-
processing steps (Task 4), the different models and optimization steps (Task 5) in a table/graph. Report your observations discuss their implications
(e.g., Model X with Optimization Y after preprocessing step Z was the
most/least effective because ABC...).
