# Checklist for LaTeX Document

### General Structure:
- [ ] Ensure the document is well-organized into tasks.
- [ ] Title, author, and institution are properly formatted.
- [ ] Abstract contains a concise description of motivation, methodology, and results.
- [ ] All necessary sections for Task 1-6 are included.
- [ ] References and links are properly formatted for each section.

### Task 1: BYOD (Dataset Introduction)
- [ ] Clearly introduce the dataset, background, and motivation.
- [ ] Include a brief on the significance of the dataset.
- [ ] Explain the goals, challenges, and potential impact of solving the problem.

### Task 2: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- [ ] Present five different aspects of analysis (image size, class imbalance, clustering, etc.).
- [ ] Add meaningful explanations and visualizations for each analysis.
- [ ] Clearly document findings and insights from each analysis.

### Task 3: Problem Definition (Revisiting Task 1)
- [ ] Refine the problem based on insights from EDA.
- [ ] Clearly justify the choice of problem and explain its significance.

### Task 4: Preprocessing
- [ ] Include detailed steps of data preprocessing.
- [ ] Explain transformations applied and justify their necessity.
- [ ] Separate image/text-specific preprocessing methods.

### Task 5: Model Selection, Training, and Optimization
- [ ] List at least five distinct models (KNN, Naive Bayes, CNN, etc.).
- [ ] Explain hyperparameters, optimization techniques (grid search, cross-validation, etc.).
- [ ] Add comparisons between vanilla and optimized versions of models.

### Task 6: Model Evaluation
- [ ] Use at least four performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
- [ ] Compare and analyze different preprocessing steps and models.
- [ ] Include graphs or tables comparing results.
- [ ] Conclude with a detailed discussion of the findings.

### Hyperparameter Tables
- [ ] Ensure all tables for hyperparameters (KNN, Random Forest, CNN) are well-formatted.
- [ ] Hyperparameter options should be clearly listed and explained.

### References
- [ ] Use both inline citations (`\href{}`) and a list of references at the end.
- [ ] All referenced materials are properly formatted.

### Miscellaneous:
- [ ] Spelling and grammar check throughout the document.
- [ ] Ensure all LaTeX packages used are necessary and properly formatted.
